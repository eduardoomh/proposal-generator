            "description": "<p>We propose to carry out a comprehensive network discovery process to document your network infrastructure, including your internal networking equipment and the links connecting to your existing service provider’s network. Our primary focus will be on your core routers and connected devices. The objective is to gain a complete understanding of your network’s Layer 2 and Layer 3 topology, which will enable us to provide improvement recommendations and support future discussions with you regarding expansion, design, and architecture tasks.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This discovery process will also be specically aimed at preparing your network for a smooth migration to IPv6, assessing the current state of addressing, equipment compatibility, and necessary congurations for a seamless transition.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>To achieve this, we will need access to the management interfaces of your equipment. This will allow us to validate your network topology rsthand, including elements that may not be visible through other means, such as conguration les. <strong>﻿</strong>Our main focus will be on optimizing your CORE network. We will work closely with you and your sta to ll any information gaps or answer any questions, which will help us make the most of our time and ensure ecient progress.</p>",

Once the documents are generated, your assigned engineer will contact you to provide a status update on your network and discuss the recommendations to bring your network to the desired level. We are committed to delivering a comprehensive and eective network discovery process, and we look forward to working with you to achieve your goals.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This will be a joint eort by IPA team members. Wherever possible, we will use the lowest-cost appropriate resource for a particular task to make the most ecient use of your retainer funds. We will begin the discovery process by scheduling a conference call with one of our experienced engineers, who will be your primary point of contact throughout the project. During the call, we will arrange secure access to your equipment, enabling us to begin the discovery process.</p>"
